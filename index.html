		<p><h2>1. - Rocket Jumps</h2>
			<h3>Start with you feet shoulder width apart and go into a normal squat. Make sure to sit back and keep your weight on your heels.<div> Jump out of your squat throwing your arms high into the air. Land light on your feet in another squat and immediately jump back up.</div></h3></p>

		<p><h2>2. - Pull Ups </h2>
			<h3>Pull ups or chin ups can develop great shoulder strength and health. Just imagine for a minute what your body has to resist to hang from a bar.<br> Gravity is trying to pull your shoulders out of their sockets.<br>Of course this will not happen and all of your shoulder musculature, including the rotator cuff muscles will be working extremely hard to prevent this. In addition grip strength is also trained.<br></h3></p>

		<p><h2>3. - Farmers Walk</h2>
			<h3>So simple, so sinister. Pick up some heavy weights in your hands and go for a walk. Excellend for trunk stabilization, grip strength (a strong grip = strong shoulders) and upper back development.<br></h3></p>

		<p><h2>4. - Push Ups</h2>
			<h3>Great pushing exercise to use instead of your traditional bench press.Something that can be added is the use of some kind of instability to the hands.<br>This can easily be accomplished by placing your hands on a exercise ball or anything that moves</h3></p>

		<p><h2>5. - Crawling</h2>
			<h3>So simple, many variations and a great conditioning tool if used appropriately.<br> It has been shown that closed chain exercises do a very good job of activating the shoulder muscular stabilizers.Since you are generally alternating your hands there is a nice sequence of off/on activation of the shoulder stabilizers.<br></h3></center></p>
